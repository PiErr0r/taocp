### Explanations of exercise difficulty
- **Warmups** are exercises that every reader should try to do when first reading the material.
- **Basics** are exercises to develop facts that are best learned by trying one's own derivation rather than by reading somebody else's.
- **Homework** exercises are problems intended to deepen an understanding of material in the current chapter.
- **Exam problems** typically involve ideas from two or more chapters simultaneously; they are generally intended for use in take-home exams (not for in-class exams under time pressure).
- **Bonus problems** go beyond what an average student of concrete mathematics is expected to handle while taking a course based on this book; they extend the text in interesting ways.
- **Research problems** may or may not be humanly solvable, but the ones presented here seem to be worth a try (without time pressure).
